This is a placeholder for the peaceful_mind.mp3 audio file.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual MP3 file containing calming music.

The app will look for files like:
- peaceful_mind.mp3
- let_it_go.mp3
- inner_peace.mp3
- breathe_deep.mp3
- etc.

For now, the app will use fallback calming tones when these files are not found.
